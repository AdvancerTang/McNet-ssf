 &nbsp; When people are talking, there may be interference such as video and music around them, which may lead to the decrease of ASR, the algorithm in this program can be used to enhance the voice of speaker.
 &nbsp;The audio named with **before** is the original audio, which was collected using a 6-channel microphone array in office,while the audio named with **after** is the  enhanced audio by the algorithm.<br>
 &nbsp;There is a man who is talking with video interfer and music interfer, the audio named with **video** stand for TV interfer,with **music** stand for music interfer,**50** means the speaker is 50Â° relative to the reference microphone.

  &nbsp; The wave spectrum of the video interfer is shown in Fig.1,(a) is the raw wave, (b) is the spectrum of clean speech processed by this program.
