# Spatially selective filter
&nbsp; The program is used to select the speaker in the target direction based on neural network,which can also be used for noise reduction.The effectiveness of the program is shown in the folders.

&nbsp; The purpose of this project is as follows.<br>


* Speaker select


 &nbsp;When many people are talking at the same time, the program can be used to select the speaker of interest based on his or her direction. The folder named **Speaker setect** include the raw audio captured by microphone array
and the audio processed with neural network, which is presented by this program.


* Noise suppression

  
&nbsp; When people are talking in a noisy environment, it can be used to reduce noise and obtain clean speaker audio. The folder named **ns** include the raw audio captured by microphone array and the single channel clean audio processed by this program.



* Speech enhancement

  
&nbsp; When people are talking, there may be multi type of interfers such as video and music, which may lead to the decrease of ASR, the algorithm in this program can be used to enhance the voice of speaker. The folder named **SE** include the raw audio captured by microphone array and the single channel clean audio processed by the algorithm in this program.
